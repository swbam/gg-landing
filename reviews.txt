Mr. George was very helpful, he answered all my questions. I'm glad I listened to his advice and recommendation on the appeal process. I would recommend him to anyone looking for disability assistance. My calls and emails were returned promptly and everything went as smoothly as could be expected.

Mr. George is a fantastic Disability Attorney. He came recommended by a friend. He listened and genuinely cares for his clients. Mr.George is not like most Attorneys charging you for every little thing. He is honest fair and in my opinion the best Attorney to handle Disability claims. He exceeded all my expectations got my case fully favorable with backpay and benefits. My family is in a much better situation thanks to Mr. George. Thank You Sir!

Chris George exceeded my expectations in delivering quality, professional service. Turn around from initial submitting my claim to being approved was less than 90 days.
I highly recommend him and his team help you with your disability needs.

Chris George and his team were amazing to work with. After the stress of going thru the disability system for several years on own truly wish we had called them earlier, they were quick to respond, and made sure to walk us thru and connect on terms we understood. Was so efficient and detailed appreciated Chris straightforward approach. Hopefully you will never need their services but in the event you do, I can’t recommend them enough.

Chris and his paralegal were nothing but kind, professional, and encouraging throughout the entire process.

Fighting for disability can be frustrating, and at times, soul-crushing. After my husband was denied once and then turned down by a large, well-known disability firm, I convinced him to give Chris a try, and I'm SO glad we did.

He was with us every step of the way--leading each appeal and the eventual favorable hearing. Even if my husband had lost his case in the end, this would absolutely be a 5-star review, still.

Chris gave us hope, and for that, I'll forever be grateful.

We experienced an absolutely flawless transaction from start to finish with this office. We never had to repeat ourselves, make numerous phone calls, wait on return phone calls, provide paperwork more than once, or any of that typical back & forth junk that we had previously experienced at an injury law office. The Paralegal had all her ducks in a row with each conversation, which we have learned from other "larger" firms is a true blessing. She kept communications simple and efficient. Chris jumped right in on several occasions, making calls, texts & emails on his own, in order to keep the process flowing in a timely manner. He gets his hands dirty & we respect that. They make a great team. We highly recommend this firm, staffed with friendly, helpful people who are highly skilled in all aspects of disability law. Gallatin is lucky to have you.

Chris Geroge is an amazing and kind attorney. He helped me with my disability case when no one else would. I was so sick, and disability kept denying me, but with Chris standing up for me finally after 3 years gave me what I needed. Thank you for your very fine work.

In my opinion from the very start very disrespectful over the phone had a very bad attitude when asked questions as if he didn't have the time of day. Perhaps he was having a bad day but a potential clients is not one to take it out on. I would rather take my business elsewhere to someone who at least pretends to care

To apply for and to be awarded social security disability benefits is built into a system designed to confuse. George and George make the confusing clear.
